          and recognition of their special trade and missionary contacts with Britain. They feared a takeover by nations like France, and wanted to stop the lawlessness of the British people in their country.</p>

          <p class="paragraph no-view">The Treaty had three articles:</p>
          <p class="paragraph no-view"><strong>I.</strong> That the Queen (or king) of Great Britain has the right to rule over New Zealand</p>
          <p class="paragraph no-view"><strong>II.</strong> That Māori chiefs would keep their land and their chieftainships, and would agree to sell their land only to the British monarch; and</p>

          <p class="paragraph no-view">It is the second and third articles have caused controversy through the years, mainly because of translation problems. Successive governments believed the Treaty enabled complete sovereignty over Māori, their lands and
            resources. But Māori believed that they were merely giving permission for the British to use their land.</p>

        <p class="paragraph no-view">Disputes over ownership followed involving a series of violent conflicts during the 19th century. These became known as the New Zealand Land Wars, and were concentrated around Northland and the southern part of the North Island during the 1840s, and the central North Island in the 1860s. Both sides suffered losses, with the Brittish Crown the eventual victor. Land confiscation and questionable land sales carried on through to the 20th century, until the vast majority of land in New Zealand was owned by settlers and the Crown.</p>

        <p class="paragraph no-view">Following its signing, many of the rights guaranteed to Māori in the Treaty of Waitangi were ignored. To help rectify this, the Waitangi Tribunal was set up in 1975. Disagreements over the terms of the treaty continue to
          this day, and the Tribunal has ruled on a number of claims brought by Māori iwi (tribes) and in many cases, compensation has been granted.</p>
        <p class="paragraph no-view">The grounds and building where the treaty was signed have been preserved. Today, the Waitangi Historic Reserve is a popular tourist attraction. Here you can explore the museum, watch a cultural performance inside the
          carved Māori meeting house, and visit the colonial mission house, historic flagstaff, and beautiful waka taua (Māori war canoe).</p>
